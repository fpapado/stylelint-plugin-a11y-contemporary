## FAQ

### What's up with the versions, like `2500.1.0`?

This package uses epoch-based SemVer, with an epoch corresponding to the last two digits of the year \* 100. For example, the epoch of the year 2025 would be 25 \* 100 = 2500. Versions within an epoch are done as usual in SemVer, for example `2501.0.0` is a major, `2501.2` is a minor, and `2501.2.5` is a patch.

If this package ends up being used in 21XX and beyond, we have bigger problems :)

We use epoch versioning in order to signal what the "current" year of the recommended ruleset is. All major bumps are SemVer major bumps as usual, whether within a given epoch, or between epochs. The epochs are just an easy way to show people when the rulesets were last revisited, since accessibility guidance and browser practices change over time..
